# Audit Task

This project uses beads for issue tracking.

## Target
<!-- What part of the site/codebase to audit -->
(part of the site)

## Roles
<!-- 1-3 roles that define the perspective of each investigator -->
- (role 1, e.g., senior engineer)
- (role 2, e.g., staff engineer)
- (role 3, e.g., security specialist)

## Focus Areas
<!-- What the audit should focus on -->
- (focus area 1)
- (focus area 2)

## Rules
- Only raise issues that have real impact. Do not manufacture problems.
- Do not raise issues outside the audit's focus areas.
- If an existing bead already covers a finding, update it — do not create a duplicate.
- If there are no issues, say so. An empty audit is a valid outcome.
