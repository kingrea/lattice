# Audit Task

This project uses beads for issue tracking.

## Bead Prefix

Use `{{ .BeadPrefix }}` for any issues opened from this audit.

## Target

{{ .Target }}

## Roles

{{- range .Roles }}
- {{ . }}
{{- end }}

## Focus Areas

{{- range .FocusAreas }}
- {{ . }}
{{- end }}

## Rules
- Only raise issues that have real impact. Do not manufacture problems.
- Do not raise issues outside the audit's focus areas.
- If an existing bead already covers a finding, update it - do not create a duplicate.
- If there are no issues, say so. An empty audit is a valid outcome.
